You are acting as a senior frontend engineer fixing eraser behavior in CollabCanvas.

CONTEXT:
The app supports freehand strokes (pixel-based) and shapes/text (object-based).
Currently, the eraser visually removes parts of shapes/text by painting white pixels,
but the underlying objects still exist and reappear when moved.
This is incorrect and misleading behavior.

GOAL:
Fix eraser behavior to be logically correct, predictable, and interview-safe.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- DO NOT paint white to simulate erasing
- DO NOT add masking, rasterization, or complex geometry logic
- DO NOT refactor canvas or socket architecture
- DO NOT add new libraries
- Keep undo/redo working as-is
- Keep shapes and text object-based
- Keep strokes pixel-based

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EXPECTED CORRECT BEHAVIOR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Eraser works ONLY on freehand brush strokes
2. Eraser MUST NOT affect:
   - Shapes (rectangle, circle, line)
   - Text objects
3. Shapes and text can ONLY be removed via:
   - Select tool → Delete action
4. When a shape or text is selected:
   - Eraser must be disabled or ignored
   - No visual erase illusion should occur

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TASKS (WORK AUTONOMOUSLY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Identify where eraser logic currently applies to all drawables
2. Remove any logic that:
   - Paints white pixels
   - Uses eraser on shapes or text
3. Restrict eraser logic to stroke-type entities only
4. Ensure move/select always reflects true object state
5. Ensure no hidden or “fake erased” pixels remain
6. Add minimal guard conditions (no UX redesign)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✔ Eraser cleanly erases brush strokes only  
✔ Shapes/text never partially erase  
✔ No white overlay hacks exist  
✔ Moving objects never reveals erased areas  
✔ Logic is simple and explainable in interviews  

Act like a senior engineer making the final pre-interview fix.
Proceed immediately without asking questions.
