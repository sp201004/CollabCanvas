You are acting as a senior technical reviewer evaluating my project:

PROJECT TITLE:
"CollabCanvas – Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas"

YOUR TASK:
Perform a strict compliance review of the current codebase, UI, and documentation
against the assignment requirements provided below.

DO NOT:
- Rewrite the app
- Refactor architecture
- Add new features unless explicitly missing
- Add new libraries

ONLY:
- Verify
- Audit
- Report gaps
- Suggest minimal fixes (if needed)

==============================
1️⃣ CORE FUNCTIONALITY CHECK
==============================

Verify the following are implemented and working:

- Multi-user real-time drawing on the same canvas
- WebSocket-based synchronization (Socket.io or native WS)
- Drawing visible WHILE another user is drawing (not after mouse up)
- Brush + Eraser tools using raw Canvas API
- Color selection works correctly
- Stroke width changes affect drawing immediately
- User presence list (online users)
- Unique color assigned per user
- Cursor / pointer indicators for other users
- Undo / Redo works globally across users
- Conflict handling when users draw simultaneously

Mark each item as:
✔ Implemented
⚠ Partially implemented
❌ Missing

==============================
2️⃣ TECHNICAL QUALITY REVIEW
==============================

Check and report on:

- Canvas performance (no full redraw on every frame)
- Path optimization / batching of draw events
- Handling of high-frequency pointer/mouse events
- Proper serialization of draw events
- Network latency tolerance
- Client-side prediction (if any)
- State consistency across reconnects

==============================
3️⃣ BONUS FEATURES VERIFICATION
==============================

Verify status of:

- Mobile touch support (Pointer Events / Touch Events)
- Room system (isolated canvases per room)
- Drawing persistence (save/load behavior)
- Performance metrics (FPS counter, latency display)
- Creative tools (shapes, text, images)

Clearly state:
✔ Implemented
⚠ Limited / Partial
❌ Not implemented
(Optional features should NOT be penalized heavily)

==============================
4️⃣ UI / UX REVIEW
==============================

Check UI quality:

- Toolbar layout consistency
- Color picker usability
- Size slider + input alignment
- Responsive behavior (desktop + mobile)
- FPS / latency indicator placement (top header)
- Room code visibility and sharing UX
- First landing page flow:
  - Name input
  - Create room
  - Join existing room (with validation)

==============================
5️⃣ ROOM & JOIN LOGIC VALIDATION
==============================

Verify:

- Room codes are validated (length, format)
- Invalid room codes cannot auto-create rooms
- Join vs Create flow is clearly separated
- Room code input has max length and character constraints
- Room IDs are predictable or well-documented
- Sharing room code works correctly

==============================
6️⃣ DOCUMENTATION CHECK
==============================

Verify README.md includes:

- Correct project title
- Setup instructions (npm install && npm start)
- Multi-user testing steps
- Known limitations
- Time spent
- Architecture summary

Verify ARCHITECTURE.md includes:

- Data flow explanation
- WebSocket message formats
- Undo/Redo strategy
- Conflict resolution strategy
- Performance decisions

==============================
7️⃣ CODE QUALITY & INTERVIEW READINESS
==============================

Evaluate:

- No copy-paste boilerplate
- Meaningful variable/function names
- Comments explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Error handling exists (null checks, socket errors)
- Code explainable line-by-line in interview
- Git history quality (if visible)

==============================
8️⃣ FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
==============================

Return results in this format:

- Compliance score (out of 100)
- Section-wise checklist table
- Key strengths (bullet points)
- Critical gaps (if any)
- Optional improvement suggestions (clearly marked OPTIONAL)

Be strict, professional, and unbiased.
Act like a real interviewer reviewing a take-home assignment.
