You are fixing the custom color picker UI in an existing collaborative canvas app.

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT rewrite the app
- DO NOT refactor drawing or WebSocket logic
- DO NOT add external libraries
- Make ONLY minimal UI / CSS + small JS changes
- Everything must be interview-explainable

PROBLEM:
- Selected custom colors are rendering as multiple overlapping circles
- Color previews stack on top of each other
- The color picker does not feel clean or professional

EXPECTED CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
- There must be ONLY ONE active custom color preview
- New color selections must REPLACE the previous preview
- No overlapping or duplicate color elements
- Color picker should feel like a proper color-wheel style picker

WHAT TO FIX:

1. Single color source of truth:
   - Maintain ONE color state for the entire color system
   - Do NOT create new preview elements on each selection

2. Custom color picker:
   - Use a single styled native color input
   - Clicking the preview should open the picker
   - Update the preview live while dragging
   - Ensure only one preview element exists in the DOM

3. Preset colors:
   - Selecting a preset color should:
     - Clear custom color active state
     - Update the same single preview element
   - Do NOT add new circles

4. Active state visibility:
   - Active color must be clearly highlighted
   - Black/dark colors must still show a visible active ring

5. Layout & containment:
   - Ensure all color UI stays inside the COLOR section
   - Prevent overflow and stacking
   - Clean spacing and alignment

CHANGE RULES:
- Prefer CSS fixes (positioning, visibility, borders)
- Minimal JS only for syncing color state
- No change to canvas drawing behavior
- Add short comments explaining WHY duplicate previews were removed

AFTER FIX:
- Briefly confirm that:
  - Color overlap is resolved
  - Only one color preview exists
  - Color picker feels clean and interactive

Act like a senior frontend engineer fixing a color-state and UI duplication bug.
