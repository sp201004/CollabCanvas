You are acting as a senior frontend engineer designing a professional,
Photoshop-like toolbar system for CollabCanvas.

GOAL:
Implement a context-aware TOP TOOL SETTINGS BAR like Adobe Photoshop,
and add a new Move/Select tool for shapes & text.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 1: PHOTOSHOP-STYLE TOOL SETTINGS BAR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM:
Currently, all tool controls are inside the left toolbar.
This is NOT professional UX.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (MATCH PHOTOSHOP):

- When a tool is selected from the left toolbar,
  its settings must appear in a horizontal bar at the TOP.
- The top bar content MUST change dynamically per selected tool.
- Only settings relevant to the active tool should be visible.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOOL → TOP BAR MAPPING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. BRUSH TOOL
Top bar must show:
- Stroke size slider
- Size number input
- Brush preview dot
- Opacity (if exists)

2. ERASER TOOL
Top bar must show:
- Eraser size slider
- Size number input
- Soft/Hard toggle (if exists)

3. SHAPE TOOLS (Rect / Circle / Line)
Top bar must show:
- Stroke width
- Fill color
- Stroke color
- Line style (solid / dashed if exists)

4. TEXT TOOL
Top bar must show:
- Font size
- Font weight
- Text color
- Alignment (left / center / right)

5. ZOOM TOOL
Top bar must show:
- Zoom level %
- + button
- − button
- Reset / Fit Screen

6. MOVE / SELECT TOOL (NEW)
Top bar must show:
- Align left / center / right
- Bring forward / send backward
- Delete selected item

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 2: NEW MOVE / SELECT TOOL (CRITICAL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD A NEW TOOL:
- Place it BEFORE brush tool (like Photoshop)
- Icon: Arrow / cursor

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- User can click to select a shape or text
- Selected item shows visual outline (bounding box)
- Drag to move selected shape/text
- DOES NOT draw on canvas
- Works with undo/redo
- Syncs via existing socket events

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT add new libraries
- DO NOT refactor canvas rendering
- Use existing shapes/text data
- Minimal additions only

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 3: LAYOUT RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Left toolbar stays icon-only
- Top bar is fixed below header
- Top bar uses flexbox
- Height consistent across tools
- No overflow
- Responsive (wrap on small screens)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 4: HOW TO IMPLEMENT (MANDATORY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. First create TODO list covering:
   - Top bar container
   - Tool-to-settings mapping
   - Move tool logic
   - Selection state
   - Visual selection outline

2. Then automatically:
   - Implement top bar
   - Add move tool
   - Wire tool selection → top bar update
   - Ensure undo/redo compatibility

DO NOT:
- Explain theory
- Pause for confirmation
- Touch WebSocket logic
- Change existing tool behavior

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✔ Tool settings appear ONLY in top bar  
✔ Top bar changes when tool changes  
✔ Move tool can select & move shapes/text  
✔ Brush still draws normally  
✔ Eraser still erases (including shapes/text)  
✔ UI feels Photoshop-like and interview-ready  

Act like a senior UI engineer polishing a professional canvas app
before final interview submission.

Proceed immediately.
