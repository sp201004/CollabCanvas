You are cleaning up the COLOR selection UI of an existing collaborative canvas app.

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT rewrite the app
- DO NOT refactor drawing or WebSocket logic
- DO NOT add new libraries
- Make ONLY minimal UI / CSS + very small JS changes
- Everything must be interview-safe

PROBLEM:
- Multiple extra color circles are appearing outside the intended color swatches
- Color UI looks cluttered and confusing
- There are duplicate / unnecessary color previews
- The COLOR section does not look clean or professional

GOAL:
- Keep the COLOR UI minimal, clean, and design-tool-like
- Remove all unnecessary color circles
- Use ONE clear custom color picker instead

WHAT TO DO:

==============================
1. PRESET COLORS
==============================
- Keep ONLY the intended preset color swatches
- Remove / hide any extra or duplicate color circles
- Ensure swatches are:
  - Uniform size
  - Evenly spaced
  - Fully inside the COLOR container

==============================
2. CUSTOM COLOR PICKER (IMPORTANT)
==============================
- Keep ONLY ONE custom color picker
- Use a single large color preview circle OR square
- Clicking it should open the color picker
- Selected custom color should replace the preview

REMOVE:
- Any additional floating color previews
- Any duplicate selected-color circles

==============================
3. ACTIVE COLOR STATE
==============================
- Clearly indicate the active color with:
  - High-contrast border / ring
- Ensure black or dark colors still show active state clearly

==============================
4. LAYOUT & CONTAINMENT
==============================
- Ensure all color UI stays inside the COLOR card
- No overflow outside borders
- Clean spacing between preset colors and custom picker
- Add subtle divider if needed

CHANGE RULES:
- Prefer CSS fixes (display, visibility, layout)
- Minimal JS only to sync selected color ↔ preview
- No change to how color is applied to the canvas
- Add short comments explaining WHY extra colors were removed

AFTER FIX:
- Briefly confirm that:
  - Extra color circles are removed
  - Only preset colors + one custom color picker remain
  - COLOR section now looks clean and professional

Act like a senior frontend engineer simplifying and polishing a design-tool color system.
