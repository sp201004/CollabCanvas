You are reviewing my project “CollabCanvas – Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas”
to verify whether it fully follows the given assignment requirements.

THIS IS A REVIEW / AUDIT TASK — NOT A BUILD TASK.

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT rewrite the app
- DO NOT refactor code
- DO NOT add new features
- DO NOT add libraries
- DO NOT change architecture
- ONLY inspect, verify, and report

==================================================
ASSIGNMENT COMPLIANCE CHECK
==================================================

CHECK THE FOLLOWING AREAS ONE BY ONE:

--------------------------------------------------
1. CORE FUNCTIONALITY
--------------------------------------------------
Verify:
- Multiple users can draw simultaneously
- Real-time drawing sync (strokes visible while drawing, not after)
- Cursor / user indicators work correctly
- Drawing tools exist (pen, eraser, color, size)
- Undo / Redo works globally or is clearly documented if limited
- Overlapping drawings do not break canvas state

Report:
- ✔ Fully implemented
- ⚠ Partially implemented
- ❌ Missing

--------------------------------------------------
2. CANVAS & PERFORMANCE
--------------------------------------------------
Verify:
- Raw Canvas API usage (no drawing libraries)
- Smooth drawing (path optimization / throttling)
- High-frequency mouse/touch events handled safely
- Canvas redraw strategy is reasonable

--------------------------------------------------
3. REAL-TIME ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------
Verify:
- WebSocket (or Socket.io) is used correctly
- Drawing events are serialized and broadcast
- Events are scoped per room
- Network latency does not break sync

--------------------------------------------------
4. ROOM SYSTEM
--------------------------------------------------
Verify:
- Multiple isolated rooms exist
- Users in one room cannot see another room
- Room IDs are random and validated
- Join/Create flow requires username
- URL does NOT auto-join without user intent

--------------------------------------------------
5. STATE MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------
Verify:
- Drawing state consistency across users
- Undo/Redo strategy is documented or explained
- Conflict handling is reasonable and documented

--------------------------------------------------
6. BONUS FEATURES (CHECK ONLY IF PRESENT)
--------------------------------------------------
Check if implemented:
- Mobile touch support
- Drawing persistence
- Performance metrics (FPS, latency)
- Creative tools (shapes, text, images)

If missing, confirm they are OPTIONAL and do not break core requirements.

--------------------------------------------------
7. PROJECT STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------
Verify:
- Folder structure matches assignment guidelines
- Files are logically separated
- Code is readable and organized

--------------------------------------------------
8. DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------
Verify README.md includes:
- Setup instructions
- Multi-user testing steps
- Known limitations
- Time spent

Verify ARCHITECTURE.md includes:
- Data flow explanation
- WebSocket message structure
- Undo/Redo strategy
- Performance decisions
- Conflict resolution explanation

--------------------------------------------------
9. CODE QUALITY
--------------------------------------------------
Verify:
- No obvious copy-paste tutorial code
- Comments are meaningful
- Error handling exists
- Code is explainable line-by-line

==================================================
FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
==================================================

1. Overall Compliance Score (out of 100)
2. Clear table:
   - Requirement
   - Status (✔ / ⚠ / ❌)
   - Notes
3. Top 3 strengths of the project
4. Top 3 risks or weak areas (if any)
5. Interview-readiness verdict:
   - READY / NEEDS MINOR FIXES / NOT READY

Act like a senior reviewer evaluating a real interview assignment.
