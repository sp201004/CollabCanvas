You are acting as a senior frontend engineer performing a FINAL strict audit on the CollabCanvas project.

GOAL:
Perform a complete end-to-end verification of the application.
Identify ANY remaining UI, UX, logic, or compliance issues.
If issues exist, fix them autonomously.
If no issues exist, clearly confirm the project is INTERVIEW READY.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SCOPE OF CHECK (MANDATORY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. TOOLBAR UI & UX
- Verify toolbar alignment, spacing, and stability
- Ensure no overflow, overlap, or broken layout
- Confirm size control (slider + number input) is fully visible & usable
- Confirm toolbar responsiveness on small screens
- Ensure sections follow correct order:
  DRAW → SHAPES → UNDO/REDO → CLEAR → COLOR → SIZE → VIEW → FILE
- Toolbar must be Canva-like, vertical, clean, and professional

2. FEATURE COMPLIANCE
- Real-time drawing during pointer move
- Multi-user rooms with isolation
- Brush, eraser, shapes, text
- Global undo/redo for strokes AND shapes
- Cursor sync respects zoom & pan
- Mobile drawing works via Pointer Events
- Performance optimizations intact (rAF, batching, debounce)

3. FORBIDDEN FEATURES (MUST NOT EXIST)
Confirm complete removal of:
- LocalStorage auto-save
- Session persistence
- JSON export
- JSON import
- Any UI, logic, or docs referencing the above

4. CODE QUALITY & SAFETY
- No dead code
- No unused UI
- Proper socket cleanup
- Proper animation/timer cleanup
- No console.logs or commented hacks
- TypeScript types correct
- Naming consistency checked

5. DOCUMENTATION
- README complete & accurate
- ARCHITECTURE.md aligned with actual implementation
- Known limitations correctly documented
- No claims of removed features

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HOW TO WORK (STRICT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. First create a TODO list of any remaining issues (if any)
2. Fix issues one-by-one automatically
3. Do NOT ask questions
4. Do NOT refactor unrelated logic
5. Do NOT add new libraries
6. If NO issues exist, say so clearly

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Return ONLY:
- Final compliance verdict (PASS / FAIL)
- Compliance score (out of 100)
- Short list of remaining risks (if any)
- Clear statement: “INTERVIEW READY” or “NOT READY”

Be strict. Assume this is the last review before submission.
