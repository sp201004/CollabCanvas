You are acting as a senior canvas + frontend engineer.

PROJECT:
CollabCanvas – Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas

DECISION (FINAL & INTENTIONAL):
This project will use a PURE STROKE-BASED DRAWING MODEL.
There will be NO object-based manipulation.

Therefore:
❌ Move / Select tool must be REMOVED COMPLETELY
❌ Shapes and text must NOT exist as movable objects
✅ Everything must behave like strokes (Paint / Whiteboard style)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
GOAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Remove Move/Select tool entirely
2. Convert Shapes and Text to stroke-based rendering
3. Ensure eraser works naturally and partially on:
   - Brush strokes
   - Shape strokes
   - Text strokes
4. Keep undo/redo fully functional
5. Keep real-time sync intact

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STRICT RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- DO NOT keep any object-based state for shapes or text
- DO NOT keep selection boxes or move logic
- DO NOT fake erase using white paint
- DO NOT add new libraries
- Use raw Canvas API only
- Minimal, safe changes
- Interview-explainable design

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MANDATORY CHANGES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ REMOVE MOVE TOOL
- Remove Move/Select tool button from toolbar
- Remove keyboard shortcut (V)
- Remove selection logic, bounding boxes, drag handlers
- Remove delete-via-selection logic
- Clean up related state variables and code paths

2️⃣ SHAPES → STROKES
- Rectangle, circle, line must be rendered as canvas paths
- On mouseup / commit:
  - Convert shape preview into stroke path(s)
  - Store as stroke data (points / path commands)
- Do NOT store shapes as objects after commit

3️⃣ TEXT → STROKES
- Text must be rendered directly onto canvas
- After commit:
  - Text becomes part of canvas pixels / stroke history
  - No text object remains
- Text cannot be selected or moved after draw
- Undo is the only way to revert text placement

4️⃣ ERASER (CRITICAL)
- Eraser must use:
  ctx.globalCompositeOperation = "destination-out"
- Eraser must work uniformly on:
  ✔ brush strokes
  ✔ shape strokes
  ✔ text strokes
- No full deletion on touch
- No hidden objects under erased pixels

5️⃣ UNDO / REDO
- Undo restores erased pixels
- Redo re-applies erase
- Shape/text strokes behave same as brush strokes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DOCUMENTATION UPDATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Update README / ARCHITECTURE.md to state clearly:

- This is a stroke-based collaborative drawing canvas
- Shapes and text are rasterized to strokes on commit
- Eraser is pixel-based and consistent across all draw types
- Move/select of objects is intentionally not supported
- Users reposition drawings via undo + redraw

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✔ No Move tool exists anywhere  
✔ Shapes behave like brush strokes  
✔ Text behaves like brush strokes  
✔ Eraser partially erases everything  
✔ No white overlay hacks  
✔ No object reappears after erase  
✔ Canvas feels like MS Paint / Whiteboard  
✔ Architecture is simple & interview-safe  

Act like a senior engineer simplifying the system
for correctness, usability, and interview readiness.
Proceed immediately without asking questions.
