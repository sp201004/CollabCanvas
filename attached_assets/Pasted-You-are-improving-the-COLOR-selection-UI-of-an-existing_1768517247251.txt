You are improving the COLOR selection UI of an existing collaborative canvas app.

VERY IMPORTANT RULES:
- DO NOT rewrite the app
- DO NOT refactor drawing logic or WebSocket logic
- DO NOT add external libraries
- Make ONLY scoped UI/CSS + minimal JS changes
- Changes must be interview-explainable

PROBLEMS TO FIX:
1. Color swatches look cluttered and poorly aligned
2. When black color is selected, other colors become hard to see
3. Active color state is not clearly visible
4. Custom color picker looks basic and not interactive
5. Overall color UX does not feel professional (Canva-like)

EXPECTED CORRECT BEHAVIOR:

==============================
1. PRESET COLOR SWATCHES
==============================
- All color swatches must be:
  - Same size
  - Evenly spaced
  - Clearly visible on light backgrounds
- Selected color must be clearly highlighted using:
  - White outer ring OR
  - Dual border (inner color + outer contrast)
- Selection highlight must work for dark colors (black) as well

DO NOT:
- Hide other colors when black is selected
- Rely only on shadow for active state

==============================
2. ACTIVE COLOR VISIBILITY
==============================
- Ensure active color always has:
  - High-contrast outline
  - Clear focus state
- Black color must still show a visible selection ring
- Use outline + background contrast, not color alone

==============================
3. CUSTOM COLOR PICKER (IMPORTANT)
==============================
- Replace basic input feel with a more interactive experience:
  - Large color preview circle
  - Hue/saturation selector style (HTML color input enhanced)
- On open:
  - Show a preview of selected color
  - Update color live while dragging
- Ensure picker feels deliberate and “design-tool-like”

ALLOWED:
- Native <input type="color"> styled cleanly
- Custom preview element synced with input
- Smooth transitions (CSS only)

NOT ALLOWED:
- External color picker libraries
- Heavy JS logic

==============================
4. LAYOUT & POLISH
==============================
- Keep COLOR section fully contained
- Add subtle divider between preset colors and custom picker
- Consistent padding and spacing
- Match visual language of the rest of the toolbar

==============================
CHANGE RULES:
- Prefer CSS fixes (flex/grid, borders, outlines)
- Minimal JS only for syncing preview ↔ input
- No change to how color is applied to canvas
- Add short comments explaining WHY visibility improvements were needed

==============================
AFTER COMPLETION:
==============================
- Briefly confirm:
  - Active color visibility is fixed
  - Black color selection no longer hides other colors
  - Custom color picker feels interactive and professional

Act like a senior frontend engineer polishing a design-tool color system (Canva/Figma-inspired UX).
