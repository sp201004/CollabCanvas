You are a senior frontend + realtime systems engineer.

Project: Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas (React + TypeScript + HTML5 Canvas + Socket.io)

GOAL:
Bring this project to **100% interview-safe, production-grade quality** by:
1. Auditing the entire codebase
2. Creating a strict TODO list
3. Automatically fixing issues ONE BY ONE in correct priority
4. Re-auditing after each fix
5. Stopping only when everything is clean and justified

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT ask me questions
- Do NOT stop midway
- Do NOT introduce new features unless explicitly required
- Follow assignment constraints strictly
- Raw Canvas API only (no drawing libraries)
- NO localStorage, NO export/import, NO persistence
- Memory-only canvas state is INTENTIONAL
- Fix code + documentation together
- Explain WHY only when necessary (short comments)

---

## STEP 1 — FULL PROJECT AUDIT

Audit the project against ALL of the following:

### Core Assignment Requirements
- Real-time drawing DURING pointer move (not after mouseup)
- Multi-user isolated rooms
- Brush + eraser + color + stroke width
- Cursor indicators synced with zoom/pan
- Global undo/redo (strokes + shapes)
- Conflict handling (server-authoritative)
- User presence & color assignment
- Clean WebSocket protocol
- Proper cleanup on exit

### Technical Quality
- Canvas performance (no unnecessary full redraws)
- requestAnimationFrame usage
- Point batching & debouncing
- Client-side prediction
- Correct serialization of events
- Memory + timer cleanup
- Zoom/pan math correctness
- Touch + mouse via Pointer Events

### Code Quality
- TypeScript correctness
- Naming consistency
- No dead code / console.logs
- Socket cleanup
- No forbidden storage (localStorage, persistence)
- Explainable line-by-line

### Documentation
- README completeness
- ARCHITECTURE.md completeness
- Data flow diagrams
- WebSocket event tables
- Undo/Redo explanation
- Conflict resolution explanation
- Known limitations listed

### Interview Risk Checks
- Unconventional naming (`odifyUserId`)
- Reconnection behavior
- SessionStorage usage
- Lack of auth
- No layer system

## STEP 2 — GENERATE TODO LIST

Create a TODO list grouped as:
1. 🔴 Critical (must fix)
2. 🟡 Minor (interview risk)
3. 🔵 Optional polish (ONLY if zero risk)

Each TODO must include:
- File name
- Line numbers
- Exact problem
- Expected fix strategy

---

## STEP 3 — AUTO-FIX (STRICT ORDER)

Start fixing TODOS automatically:

RULES:
- Fix ONE issue at a time
- After each fix:
  - Update code
  - Update comments if needed
  - Update README / ARCHITECTURE if relevant
  - Re-validate no rules were violated
- Then move to next TODO

MANDATORY FIXES TO INCLUDE:
- Rename `odifyUserId` → `userId` everywhere safely
- Add explicit reconnection handler:
  - On reconnect → re-request canvas state
  - Do NOT add persistence
- Ensure cursor overlay respects zoom/pan
- Verify undo/redo covers strokes AND shapes
- Ensure pointer events fully replace mouse/touch split
- Ensure socket cleanup is complete
- Ensure no accidental persistence/export exists

---

## STEP 4 — FINAL RE-AUDIT

After all fixes:
- Re-run full strict compliance audit
- Produce a FINAL REPORT with:
  - Compliance score
  - Interview readiness verdict
  - Remaining *acceptable* limitations
  - Suggested answers interviewer might ask

---

## STEP 5 — STOP CONDITION

STOP ONLY WHEN:
- Compliance ≥ 98/100
- Zero critical issues
- Only acceptable, documented limitations remain
- Project is confidently **INTERVIEW READY**

BEGIN NOW.
