You are acting as a senior interviewer and systems reviewer.

PROJECT TYPE:
Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas

REFERENCE SPECIFICATION:
You must audit the project STRICTLY against the assignment description provided below.
Do NOT assume anything beyond the spec.

❌ DO NOT modify code
❌ DO NOT fix issues
❌ DO NOT refactor
❌ ONLY inspect, verify, and report

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ASSIGNMENT COMPLIANCE CHECK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Check whether the project FULLY, PARTIALLY, or DOES NOT satisfy each requirement.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1️⃣ CORE FRONTEND FEATURES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Verify presence and correctness of:

- Brush tool
- Eraser tool
- Color selection
- Stroke width adjustment
- Smooth drawing (no lag / jitter)
- Cursor indicators for other users
- Visual indication of active users
- User color assignment
- Global Undo / Redo behavior
- Conflict handling when multiple users draw simultaneously

Mark each as:
✔ Implemented correctly
⚠️ Partially implemented
❌ Missing / broken

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2️⃣ REAL-TIME SYNCHRONIZATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Check if:
- Drawing appears in real time (while drawing, not after mouse up)
- WebSocket events are streamed efficiently
- Drawing data is serialized properly
- Network latency is handled reasonably
- Client-side prediction exists or is explained
- Multiple users can draw simultaneously without desync

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3️⃣ CANVAS MASTERY (VERY IMPORTANT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Verify evidence of:
- Path optimization
- Efficient redraw strategy
- Proper handling of high-frequency mouse/pointer events
- Layer or operation-based history for undo/redo

Note any shortcuts or inefficiencies.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4️⃣ GLOBAL STATE & UNDO / REDO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Check:
- Whether undo/redo is truly global
- How conflicts are handled (User A undoing User B)
- Whether UI reflects actual undo availability
- If canvas state stays consistent across users

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5️⃣ ROOM SYSTEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Verify:
- Multiple isolated rooms
- Correct join/create logic
- Invalid room code handling
- No accidental auto-room creation
- Room cleanup behavior
- Exit room support

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6️⃣ BONUS FEATURES (OPTIONAL — NO PENALTY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Mark clearly:
✔ Implemented
⚠️ Partial
❌ Missing

- Mobile touch support
- Drawing persistence
- FPS / latency display
- Shapes
- Text
- Images

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7️⃣ DOCUMENTATION CHECK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Verify presence & quality of:

README.md:
- Project title
- Setup instructions (npm install && npm start)
- Multi-user testing steps
- Known bugs / limitations
- Time spent on project

ARCHITECTURE.md:
- Data flow diagram
- WebSocket protocol
- Undo/redo strategy
- Performance decisions
- Conflict resolution approach

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
8️⃣ CODE QUALITY & INTERVIEW READINESS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Assess:
- Originality (no tutorial copy-paste)
- Clean structure
- Separation of concerns
- Error handling
- Explainability line-by-line
- Areas interviewer may question

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ Overall Compliance Score (/100)
2️⃣ Fully Implemented Requirements
3️⃣ Partially Implemented Requirements (what exists vs what's missing)
4️⃣ Missing Requirements (critical vs optional)
5️⃣ Major Technical or UX Issues
6️⃣ Documentation Gaps
7️⃣ Interview Risk Questions (what interviewer will ask)
8️⃣ Final Verdict: PASS / BORDERLINE / FAIL

⚠️ Do NOT fix anything
⚠️ Do NOT write code
⚠️ Do NOT suggest features not in spec

Act like an interviewer evaluating this submission for a real hiring process.
