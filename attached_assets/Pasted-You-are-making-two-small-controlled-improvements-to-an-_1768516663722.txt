You are making two small, controlled improvements to an existing collaborative canvas application.

VERY IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT rewrite the app
- DO NOT refactor logic, architecture, or WebSocket behavior
- DO NOT add any new libraries
- Make ONLY minimal, safe, interview-explainable changes

==================================================
TASK 1: UPDATE PROJECT TITLE EVERYWHERE
==================================================

NEW PROJECT TITLE (USE EXACTLY):
"CollabCanvas – Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas"

WHAT TO UPDATE:
1. Browser tab title (document.title)
2. Landing / first page main heading
3. Top header / navbar title (if present)
4. README.md project title
5. README.md first description line
6. Any visible UI text that still shows the old project name

WHAT NOT TO CHANGE:
- No JS logic changes
- No CSS redesign
- No feature changes

RULES:
- Update text only where the project name appears
- Keep formatting clean and consistent
- Add comments only if absolutely necessary

==================================================
TASK 2: FIX SIZE CONTROL UI ALIGNMENT
==================================================

PROBLEM:
- SIZE control elements are overflowing outside their container
- Slider, number input, and "px" label are misaligned
- Borders and spacing look broken
- Overall SIZE section does not look visually contained

EXPECTED CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
- SIZE control must be fully contained inside its card
- No element should overflow horizontally or vertically
- Slider, dot preview, number input, and "px" label must align cleanly
- Borders should look neat and consistent with the rest of the toolbar

WHAT TO FIX:

1. Container alignment:
   - Add proper internal padding
   - Use box-sizing: border-box
   - Prevent overflow from child elements

2. Slider + number input layout:
   - Stack elements vertically
   - Center-align items horizontally
   - Use consistent spacing (gap)

3. Number input + "px":
   - Keep input width fixed (no auto expansion)
   - Align "px" inline with input
   - Ensure both stay inside the container
   - Prevent layout push-out

4. Visual polish:
   - Rounded borders consistent with other toolbar sections
   - Light background
   - Clean internal margins

CHANGE RULES:
- Prefer CSS fixes (flexbox, padding, width, box-sizing)
- Minimal HTML changes only if unavoidable
- No JS logic changes
- Add short comments explaining WHY layout fixes were required

==================================================
AFTER COMPLETION
==================================================

- Briefly confirm:
  1. Where the project title was updated
  2. That the SIZE control is now properly aligned and contained

Act like a senior frontend engineer doing a clean rename and a precise UI alignment fix.
