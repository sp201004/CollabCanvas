You are a senior full-stack engineer assigned to fully audit and fix an existing project end-to-end.

PROJECT TITLE (MUST BE USED EVERYWHERE):
"CollabCanvas – Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas"

OBJECTIVE:
Bring this project to FULL assignment compliance and interview-ready quality.

IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR RULE:
❗ DO EVERYTHING AUTOMATICALLY
❗ DO NOT ASK FOR CONFIRMATION
❗ DO NOT PAUSE BETWEEN STEPS
❗ COMPLETE ALL STEPS IN ONE RUN

--------------------------------------------------
GLOBAL RULES:
- Do NOT rewrite the entire app
- Do NOT refactor architecture unless required
- Do NOT add unnecessary libraries
- Make safe, incremental changes
- Prefer minimal diffs
- Follow assignment spec strictly
--------------------------------------------------

STEP 1 — FULL AUDIT (READ ONLY):
Analyze the project against:
- Assignment requirements
- Bonus features list
- UI / UX correctness
- Mobile responsiveness
- Room system logic
- Undo / Redo correctness
- Error handling
- Documentation completeness

Create a PRIORITIZED TODO LIST grouped as:
1. Critical (must fix)
2. Important
3. Optional (bonus / polish)

Each TODO must include:
- Issue description
- Why it is a problem
- File / component location
- Expected correct behavior

--------------------------------------------------

STEP 2 — AUTO FIX MODE (NO STOPS):
Fix ALL TODO items automatically in this strict order:

1️⃣ Critical UX / logic bugs  
2️⃣ Assignment compliance gaps  
3️⃣ Mobile responsiveness issues  
4️⃣ Room system correctness  
5️⃣ Undo / Redo correctness  
6️⃣ Documentation gaps  
7️⃣ Optional improvements (only if low-risk)

For EACH FIX:
- Briefly explain the fix (1 line)
- Apply the change
- Show the exact code diff
- Ensure nothing breaks

DO NOT WAIT — MOVE TO NEXT FIX IMMEDIATELY.

--------------------------------------------------

MANDATORY ISSUES TO FIX IF FOUND:
- Exit / Leave Room button missing
- Header & room info disappearing on mobile
- Invalid room codes creating rooms
- Undo / Redo buttons always enabled
- Clear canvas without confirmation
- Broken or overlapping color picker
- Toolbar overflow on small screens
- Missing "Time Spent" in README
- Missing README sections per assignment
- Drawing persistence clearly documented or implemented
- Responsive layout for phone screens

--------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
Ensure README.md includes:
- Project title
- Setup instructions
- Multi-user testing steps
- Known limitations
- Time spent on project
- Optional features clearly marked

--------------------------------------------------

FINAL STEP — REPORT:
At the end, generate:
- Final compliance score
- List of all fixes applied
- Remaining optional gaps (if any)
- Interview readiness verdict

Act like an interviewer + senior engineer.
Be strict, systematic, and production-grade.
