You are improving the UI/UX of my collaborative drawing canvas by taking inspiration from Canva’s Whiteboard interface.

VERY IMPORTANT:
- This is for visual and UX inspiration ONLY
- DO NOT copy Canva code, assets, or exact layout
- DO NOT rewrite the app
- DO NOT refactor backend or WebSocket logic
- DO NOT add any libraries
- Make ONLY minimal, well-explained frontend changes

REFERENCE GOAL (Canva Whiteboard–like):
- Clean, professional, spacious whiteboard feel
- Minimal distractions
- Clear tool separation
- Comfortable drawing experience

WHAT I WANT YOU TO IMPLEMENT:

1. Canvas / Whiteboard Area:
   - Large, clean drawing area centered on screen
   - Light dotted or subtle grid background (optional, toggle-friendly)
   - Canvas should feel infinite / spacious (no cramped edges)

2. Left Toolbar (Canva-style):
   - Vertical toolbar on the left
   - Comfortable width (not narrow)
   - Rounded container with soft background
   - Clear spacing between icons

   Group tools like Canva:
   - Group 1: Drawing tools (pen, eraser)
   - Group 2: Actions (undo, redo, clear)
   - Group 3: Colors (preset swatches + custom picker)
   - Group 4: Size (slider + number input)

3. Tool Styling:
   - Uniform icon sizes
   - Active tool clearly highlighted
   - Soft hover states
   - Clean dividers between sections

4. Size Control (Canva-like UX):
   - Large, easy-to-drag slider
   - Editable number input
   - Clamp size between 1px and 50px
   - Slider + number stay in sync

5. Responsiveness:
   - Toolbar should not overlap canvas
   - UI should look clean on laptop & tablet sizes
   - Use CSS flexbox/grid + media queries only

RULES FOR CHANGES:
- Prefer CSS changes (style.css)
- Minimal HTML changes only if required
- No JS logic changes except UI state wiring
- Add short comments explaining WHY a change improves UX

AFTER COMPLETION:
- Briefly summarize how the UI now feels Canva-inspired (2–3 lines max)

Act like a senior frontend engineer recreating Canva-level UX polish, not functionality.
