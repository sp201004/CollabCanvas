You are acting as a senior full-stack engineer auditing and fixing an existing project.

PROJECT NAME:
"CollabCanvas – Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas"

GOAL:
Bring the project to full assignment compliance with clean UX, correct logic, and interview-ready quality.

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT rewrite the entire app
- DO NOT change architecture unless required
- DO NOT add unnecessary libraries
- Make incremental, safe changes only
- One fix at a time, in correct priority order
- Do NOT skip steps

STEP 1 — FULL AUDIT (NO CODE CHANGES):
Analyze the project against:
- Assignment requirements
- UI/UX correctness
- Responsiveness (desktop + mobile)
- Room system correctness
- Undo/redo logic
- Error handling
- Documentation completeness

Create a clear TODO LIST grouped by:
- Critical (must fix)
- Important
- Optional / bonus

Each TODO must include:
- What is broken
- Why it is a problem
- Where it exists (file/component)
- Expected correct behavior

DO NOT FIX ANYTHING IN STEP 1.

--------------------------------------------------

STEP 2 — AUTO-FIX MODE (ONE BY ONE):
After TODO list approval, start fixing items ONE AT A TIME in this order:

Priority order:
1. Critical UX / logic bugs
2. Assignment compliance gaps
3. Responsiveness issues
4. Documentation gaps
5. Optional improvements

For EACH FIX:
- Explain what you are changing (1–2 lines)
- Apply the fix
- Show the exact code change
- Confirm expected behavior after fix

WAIT for confirmation before moving to the next TODO.

--------------------------------------------------

MANDATORY FIXES TO CHECK FOR:
- Exit / Leave Room button missing or broken
- Header disappearing on mobile screen sizes
- Room join creating rooms even for invalid codes
- Undo/Redo buttons always enabled
- Clear canvas without confirmation
- Color picker overlapping / broken UI
- Toolbar overflow on small screens
- README.md missing required sections (especially "Time Spent")
- Drawing persistence clearly documented or implemented
- Responsive layout for phone screens

--------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENTATION RULES:
- README.md must include:
  - Project title
  - Setup instructions
  - Multi-user testing steps
  - Known limitations
  - Time spent on project
- Clearly mark OPTIONAL features as optional

--------------------------------------------------

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Step 1: TODO checklist
- Step 2+: Fixes applied one by one
- Final summary with compliance score improvement

Act like an interviewer reviewing and fixing a real production candidate project.
Be strict, honest, and systematic.
