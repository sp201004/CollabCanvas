You are acting as a senior frontend engineer fixing a broken toolbar UI in CollabCanvas.

GOAL:
Fully fix toolbar alignment, spacing, and usability.
Remove unwanted persistence features completely.
Work autonomously: create TODOs, then fix them one-by-one without stopping.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL PROBLEMS (MUST FIX)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. TOOLBAR LAYOUT IS BROKEN
- Icons are misaligned
- Sections overlap or look uneven
- Spacing between groups is inconsistent
- Brush/pen size control is visually broken (only label visible)
- VIEW / FILE / RESET sections are not aligned properly
- Toolbar looks unstable when scrolling or resizing

2. SIZE CONTROL IS BROKEN
- Slider + number input not visible properly
- Size label visible but control missing
- Layout overflow inside toolbar cards

3. RESPONSIVENESS IS BROKEN
- Toolbar does not adapt cleanly on smaller screens
- Items get cut or squeezed incorrectly

4. UNWANTED FEATURES (REMOVE COMPLETELY)
REMOVE ALL of the following:
- LocalStorage auto-save
- Session persistence
- JSON export
- JSON import
- Any UI buttons or code paths related to these

These features must be fully removed from:
- UI
- Logic
- State
- Documentation references

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EXPECTED TOOLBAR STRUCTURE (REFERENCE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Follow a Canva-like vertical toolbar structure:

- Each section in its own rounded card
- Sections stacked vertically with consistent gap
- Center-aligned icons
- Fixed width toolbar
- No element should overflow its container

Sections order:
1. DRAW (brush, eraser)
2. SHAPES (rect, circle, line, text)
3. UNDO / REDO
4. CLEAR
5. COLOR
6. SIZE (dot preview + slider + number input)
7. VIEW (zoom in, zoom out, reset)
8. FILE (only relevant actions that remain)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STRICT RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- DO NOT rewrite the app
- DO NOT refactor canvas or socket logic
- DO NOT add new libraries
- DO NOT add persistence back in any form
- ONLY fix layout, alignment, and remove features
- Use CSS (flexbox/grid) as primary fix
- Minimal HTML changes only if required
- No visual redesign, just clean alignment

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HOW TO WORK (MANDATORY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. First, create a TODO list identifying:
   - Each broken toolbar section
   - Each alignment issue
   - Each unwanted persistence feature

2. Then automatically:
   - Fix TODO #1 completely
   - Move to TODO #2
   - Continue until all TODOs are resolved

3. Do NOT pause or ask questions
4. Do NOT explain excessively
5. Add short comments only where layout fixes are non-obvious

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✔ Toolbar looks clean, stable, and aligned  
✔ Brush size control fully visible and usable  
✔ No overlapping or overflow anywhere  
✔ Responsive behavior works on smaller screens  
✔ No LocalStorage / JSON export/import exists anywhere  
✔ UI feels interview-ready and professional  

Act like a senior engineer cleaning up a broken UI before final submission.
Proceed immediately.
