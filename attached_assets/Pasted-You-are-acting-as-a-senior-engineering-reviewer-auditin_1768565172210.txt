"CollabCanvas – Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas"

YOUR TASK:
Perform a COMPLETE AUDIT of the project and identify ALL missing, broken, or partially implemented items.

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT modify code
- DO NOT fix anything
- DO NOT suggest refactors yet
- ONLY inspect, analyze, and report

- Brush/eraser size control (slider + number input)
- Color selection & custom color picker
- Shapes (rectangle, circle, line)
- Text tool (canvas-based, not alert/prompt)
- Undo / Redo (state-based, correct enable/disable)
- Clear canvas (with confirmation)
- Zoom in / zoom out / reset view
- Exit room functionality
- Share room functionality
- Active users list
- Cursor presence of other users

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2️⃣ REAL-TIME & NETWORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- WebSocket connection stability
- Real-time stroke sync
- Cursor sync
- Latency handling
- FPS / latency metrics accuracy
- Reconnect behavior
- Partial stroke recovery on disconnect

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3️⃣ ROOM SYSTEM VALIDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- New room creation flow
- Join existing room flow
- Room code validation
- Invalid room code handling
- Auto room creation on wrong code (BUG?)
- Room cleanup logic
- Exit room behavior
- Multiple room isolation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4️⃣ UI / UX AUDIT (VERY IMPORTANT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Toolbar alignment & spacing
- Toolbar responsiveness (mobile + resize)
- Section grouping clarity
- Size control visibility
- Color picker usability
- Text tool UX (canvas vs popup)
- Header visibility on small screens
- Mobile usability
- Overflow / clipping issues

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5️⃣ RESPONSIVENESS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile
- Orientation changes
- Header & toolbar behavior on small screens

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6️⃣ DOCUMENTATION CHECK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Check presence & quality of:
- README.md
  - Project title
  - Setup instructions
  - Multi-user testing steps
  - Known limitations
  - Time spent on project
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- Any missing or misleading docs

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7️⃣ OPTIONAL / BONUS FEATURES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Mark status clearly:
✔ Implemented
⚠️ Partial
❌ Missing

- Mobile touch support
- Drawing persistence
- Shapes / text / images
- Performance metrics
- Pan / zoom
- Debounced cursor updates

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
8️⃣ CODE QUALITY (HIGH LEVEL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Separation of concerns
- State management correctness
- Error handling
- Hardcoded flags (e.g. canUndo=true)
- Interview readiness
- Known risky areas

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ Summary Score (out of 100)
2️⃣ Missing Features (Critical / Optional)
3️⃣ Partially Implemented Features (what exists vs what’s missing)
4️⃣ Critical Bugs / UX Issues
5️⃣ Documentation Gaps
6️⃣ Risk Areas for Interview
7️⃣ Clear TODO List (prioritized)

⚠️ DO NOT FIX ANYTHING
⚠️ DO NOT WRITE CODE
⚠️ DO NOT ADD FEATURES

Act like an interviewer doing a deep technical + UX audit before final evaluation.
