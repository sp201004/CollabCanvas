## 📋 CHECK AGAINST THESE SECTIONS

### A. CORE FUNCTIONALITY
- Real-time drawing sync (live strokes, not end-only)
- Brush, eraser, color, stroke width
- Cursor presence for other users
- Global undo/redo correctness
- Conflict handling (overlapping strokes)
- User list + color assignment

- Toolbar usability on small screens
- Header visibility on resize
- Overflow / clipping issues
- Alignment problems (SIZE, COLOR, tools)
- Accessibility issues

### E. BONUS FEATURES (MARK STATUS CLEARLY)
For each, mark one:
✔ Implemented
⚠ Partial
✖ Missing

- Mobile touch support
- Drawing persistence
- Performance metrics (FPS, latency)
- Shapes / text / images
- Room system robustness

### F. DOCUMENTATION
Check README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md for:
- Accurate setup steps
- Data flow diagram presence
- WebSocket protocol explanation
- Undo/redo strategy explanation
- Performance decisions explained
- Known limitations listed honestly

### G. CODE QUALITY
- Any copy-paste patterns?
- Comments explain WHY vs WHAT?
- Error handling depth
- Edge-case safety
- Interview readiness
