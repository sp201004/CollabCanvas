You are a senior technical interviewer reviewing a Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + HTML Canvas
- Backend: Node.js + Socket.io
- Raw Canvas API only (no drawing libraries)

OBJECTIVE:
Perform a COMPLETE POST-FIX AUDIT and verify whether the project now qualifies as a **FULL PASS** (not borderline).

-----------------------------------
STEP 1 — RE-AUDIT CORE REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------
Verify and explicitly confirm:

1. Drawing Tools
   - Brush works
   - Eraser works using canvas composite operations
   - Color picker works (no overlapping UI)
   - Stroke width slider visible, usable, synced

2. Real-time Sync
   - Drawing streams during pointer move (not after mouse-up)
   - Multiple users see strokes live
   - Cursor indicators visible and synced

3. Global Undo / Redo (CRITICAL)
   - Undo removes strokes AND shapes
   - Redo restores strokes AND shapes
   - Global history behaves correctly across users
   - Buttons enable/disable correctly

4. Shapes & Text
   - Rectangle / circle / line are drawable
   - Shapes are undoable
   - Text input appears ON canvas (not browser prompt)
   - Text commits correctly on Enter / blur

5. Mobile Support
   - Pointer Events are used
   - touch-none is removed
   - Drawing works on mobile screens

6. Pan & Zoom
   - Zoom affects canvas correctly
   - Cursor overlay respects zoom/pan transform
   - No desync between cursor and drawing

7. Room System
   - Join via 6-char room code
   - Exit button works
   - Socket disconnects properly on exit

-----------------------------------
STEP 2 — UX / UI QUALITY CHECK
-----------------------------------
Verify:

- Toolbar alignment is clean
- Icons are evenly spaced
- Sections (Draw / Shapes / Color / Size / View) are readable
- Responsive layout works on smaller screens
- No clipped text or broken sliders

-----------------------------------
STEP 3 — CODE QUALITY & SAFETY
-----------------------------------
Check for:

- No typos (e.g. odifyUserId → userId fixed)
- TypeScript types are consistent
- Socket cleanup handled properly
- No dead code or commented hacks
- No forbidden features present:
  ❌ No LocalStorage
  ❌ No export/import
  ❌ No persistence

-----------------------------------
STEP 4 — DOCUMENTATION REVIEW
-----------------------------------
Verify:

README.md includes:
- Setup instructions
- Multi-user testing steps
- Time spent
- Known limitations

ARCHITECTURE.md includes:
- Data flow diagram
- WebSocket protocol
- Undo/redo strategy
- Conflict resolution explanation
- Performance decisions

-----------------------------------
STEP 5 — FINAL VERDICT
-----------------------------------
Provide:

1. Updated compliance score (out of 100)
2. PASS / BORDERLINE PASS / FAIL
3. Any remaining risks an interviewer may catch
4. Confirmation whether this is INTERVIEW-READY
