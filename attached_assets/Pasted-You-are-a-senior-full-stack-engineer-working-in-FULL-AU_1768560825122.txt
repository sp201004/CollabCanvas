You are a senior full-stack engineer working in FULL AUTO MODE.

PROJECT:
CollabCanvas – Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas

OBJECTIVE:
Fix ALL identified gaps and implement ALL optional improvements.
I should NOT need to do anything manually.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Do NOT ask me questions
- Do NOT pause for confirmation
- Do NOT stop between steps
- Execute everything sequentially
- Minimal, safe, incremental changes only
- No unnecessary refactors
- No new heavy libraries
- Keep code interview-ready

==================================================
PHASE 1 — AUTO AUDIT & TODO GENERATION (MANDATORY)
==================================================

1. Re-audit the project against:
   - Assignment requirements
   - Bonus features
   - UX / responsiveness
   - Documentation completeness
   - Real-time correctness

2. Generate a CLEAR, ORDERED TODO LIST grouped by:
   A. Critical (must-fix)
   B. Important
   C. Optional enhancements

3. Lock this TODO list and proceed automatically.
DO NOT WAIT.

==================================================
PHASE 2 — AUTO IMPLEMENTATION (EXECUTE IN ORDER)
==================================================

Implement each TODO ONE BY ONE in this exact order.
After finishing one, immediately move to the next.

-------------------------
A. CRITICAL FIXES
-------------------------
1. Add missing README.md sections:
   - Time spent
   - Known bugs
   - Test instructions

2. Fix Undo / Redo state:
   - canUndo / canRedo must reflect real history
   - Buttons disable correctly

3. Add Clear Canvas confirmation dialog

4. Fix Room validation:
   - Invalid room codes must NOT auto-create rooms
   - Proper “room not found” server response

5. Add Exit Room button:
   - Clean socket disconnect
   - Redirect to landing page

6. Fix responsive layout:
   - Header, room info, buttons must remain visible on mobile
   - Toolbar collapses properly on small screens

-------------------------
B. OPTIONAL FEATURES (NOW REQUIRED)
-------------------------

7. Drawing persistence:
   - Save per-room canvas state
   - Use localStorage
   - Auto-restore on reconnect
   - Add Export / Import JSON

8. Creative tools:
   - Rectangle
   - Circle
   - Line
   - Text tool
   - All synced via WebSocket
   - Undo/redo compatible

9. Pan & Zoom:
   - Mouse wheel / pinch zoom
   - Drag pan
   - Correct coordinate mapping
   - Zoom limits

10. Cursor optimization:
    - Debounce cursor updates (30–40ms)
    - Reduce socket traffic under load

==================================================
PHASE 3 — UI / UX POLISH
==================================================

11. Fix toolbar alignment issues
12. Replace color swatches with a single interactive color picker
13. Ensure size slider, inputs, labels never overflow
14. Ensure mobile touch UX remains smooth

==================================================
PHASE 4 — DOCUMENTATION UPDATE
==================================================

15. Update README.md:
    - Features list (updated)
    - Limitations (remaining only)
    - Time spent
    - Testing steps

16. Update ARCHITECTURE.md:
    - Persistence strategy
    - Shapes protocol
    - Pan/zoom math
    - Cursor debounce reasoning

==================================================
PHASE 5 — FINAL VERIFICATION
==================================================

17. Re-run compliance audit
18. Generate:
    - Final compliance score
    - Feature checklist (all implemented)
    - Remaining known limitations (if any)
    - Interview talking points (WHY choices were made)

==================================================
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- All changes applied
- No TODO left unfinished
- Project in interview-ready state
- Clear summary of improvements

Act like a senior engineer delivering a final submission.
